        <h2>Early years in the states</h2>
        <p>
            I was 8 years old when I first came to the state. My dad had work in a restaurent in Tenessse and that is where I spent the first couple of years.It was a very small town with about just 1000 people population. Very quite little place. Till this day, I can remember where everything is located. There was only one Kroger, only one Walmart, only one bank(Bank of America), only one McDonald, and many many more onlys.
        </p>

        <h2>Most fun year of teen years</h2>
        <p>
            After the three years pass, we moved to NYC due to my dads work again.<br><br>

            NYC was the first big city that I have ever lived in. It was shocking for a 12 year old. Everything felt so new and interesting. I met a lot of kids there that were just like me. They were raised in China, then they came to the State in their teens. I felt so connect to them. We share similar mindsets, had similar interests, and for the first time, I felt like I had some real friend.<br><br>

            Happy times never last long. I only had one year in NYC and had to move again for my dads work reason again. It wasn't fun. I remeber crying and all that. I didn't want to leave. I had all my friends there, all my favorite shops, restaurent and everything will get left behind. It was a really dark time for me.
        </p>

        <h2>And here we are</h2>
        <p>
            After that, we moved here to Lexington. I have been here for 9 years now. I still can't belive that its been 9 whole years. It still feels like a dream. In this 9 years, I met some new friends, had new favorite restaurent. It is also this city that gave me my first job, first car, first computer, and many many more. I have traveled back to NYC a couple of times within that 9 years. I gotta say, lately, it feeling more and more like it is more fun here and that moving here might have been a right call. With all been said, I am still living here and hoping for each days to only get better.
